Lecture - 3

Active I/P mode = I/P is provided intentionally. Command to the computer directly. Ex : Speech, Poiting to something, gesture, writing something. Computer will capture the I/P and process accordingly.

Passive I/P mode = I/P is naturally provided. Not give a command directly to the computer. Computer will capture the I/P and process accordingly. Ex : Gaze, Brain wave patterns, Lip movements, Facial Expressions.

Virtual Environment = Input may be anything ( Active or Passive ) and O/P can be provided virtually. Real life experience. 

NOTE : Recognition process will be done for both the active and passive input.




Modality Relations :  


CARE properties

CARE = Complementarity, Assignment, Redundancy, Equivalence

Complementarity = multiple modalities are used together at a time to reach O/P. Ex : Speech + Gesture will work together. ( Put the red triangle in that place ) . All the inputs combined together to provide O/P. ( ALL MODALITIES WILL WORK TOGETHER ) 

Assignment = Only one modality will be selected for use as information. Multiple modalities will be there at I/P side but only one modality will be selected at a time to give O/P. ( ONLY ONE MODALITY WILL WORK AT A TIME )

Redundancy = only a part of information will be used. Ex : (IN MIT pointing hand + voice ) -> Put the red triangle in the blue circle. If only one triangle is present then pointing hand is redundant and only voice is enough. 

Equivalence = Any available modality can be used in any manner. We can give modalities in sequential manner or parallel manner. ( SYSTEM CAN WORK WITH ANY COMBINATION OF INPUTS )




Types of multimodal systems :

Fusion based multimodal systems ( Blended multimodal systems/interfaces ) : Input should have atleast one active I/P and atleast one passive I/P to get the O/P. 
Ex : LipNet = based on CNN , Lip movement is passive and speech is active. LipNet is used in autonomous vehicles.


Temporally cascaded multimodal system : Process two or more user modalities sequenced in temporal order ( modalities working in order one after the another ). Input can be anything, that is active or passive. Ex : first gaze + then gesture.
