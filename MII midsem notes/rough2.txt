CASE And CARE

These models are used to conceptualize the diff possible relationship between input and output modalities.
There are two types of models which are :

1) CASE = it combines modalities at system side.
2) CARE = it combines modalities at user side.


CASE model

draw a circle, delete a square

alternate = two combined tasks are done in sequential manner.

fission = it finds a possible answer by deciding among various output modalities based on device and context.

3 stages : selection and structuring of contents, selection of modalities and output coordination.

coordination of each output is reqd. to form a coherent message.

Ex : Put that there, after put check for diff versions of put and accordingly decide, after there, check for diff versions and accordingly take corrective measures.
