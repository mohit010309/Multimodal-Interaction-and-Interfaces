Library Dependencies: Depending on the chosen libraries and frameworks for face recognition, audio processing, and machine learning, managing the installation, version compatibility, and potential conflicts among different libraries can be challenging.

Preprocessing: Determining the appropriate preprocessing steps for face images and voice recordings can be challenging. Choosing the right image resizing, normalization, grayscale conversion, and audio preprocessing techniques to enhance the quality and consistency of the data requires experimentation and careful consideration.

Error Handling and Validation: Implementing robust error handling mechanisms, such as handling file loading errors, data format issues, or unexpected exceptions, is crucial to ensure the stability and reliability of the code. Additionally, validating the inputs and outputs of each function or module to prevent unexpected behavior and ensure consistency can be challenging.

Code Optimization: Optimizing the code for efficiency and performance can be a challenge, especially when dealing with large datasets or real-time processing requirements. Considering memory management, parallelization, algorithmic efficiency, and code structure can contribute to better performance.

Database Management: Managing and storing the biometric data of enrolled users can be challenging. It requires efficient storage mechanisms and secure protocols to handle large amounts of data and ensure privacy and security.
